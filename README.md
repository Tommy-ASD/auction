1. This project was mostly made to learn more about Solidity
2. What the program does, simplified:
    The owner (deployer) can set payout for the auction\
    Anyone can increase the payout (this does not add to their total deposited)\
    Only the owner can end auction, and only if a set amount of players have entered\
    Anyone can bid, as long as their bid is higher than the last\
    No one can withdraw their bid\
    When owner ends auction, highest bidder gets the payout\
    Owner gets the total deposited\
3. This was based on a vSauce episode I saw once
4. I made it out of boredom
